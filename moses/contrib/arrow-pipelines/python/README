Arrow Based Moses Training Pipeline
===================================

To use the demonstration you must first initialise the git submodules for this clone. Return to the top level directory and issue the following command:

$ git submodule init

This will clone the Pypeline submodule that is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ianj-als/pypeline). To install Pypeline:

$ cd libs/pypeline
$ python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can set an appropriate PYTHONPATH enviornment variable to the Pypeline library.

This demonstration implements a training pipeline that is shown in the Dia diagram in ../documentation/training-pipeline/moses-pypeline.dia.

Three environment variables need to be set before the manager.py script can be run, they are:

 - MOSES_HOME : The directory where Moses has been cloned, or installed,
 - IRSTLM : The installation directory of your IRSTLM, and
 - GIZA_HOME : The installation directory of GIZA++.

The manager.py script takes four positional command-line arguments:

 - The source language code,
 - The target language code,
 - The source corpus file. This file *must* be cleaned prior to use, and
 - The target corpus file. This file *must* be cleaned prior to use.

For example, run the manager.py script with:

$ python manager.py en lt cleantrain.en cleantrain.lt
