Before building or running applications, please update the variables in
configs.sh to appropriate values.

The build.sh script at the top level can be used to build all or some of the
applications in a batch. The list of applications to build can be passed as
command line arguments. E.g., './build.sh img-dnn xapian' would build img-dnn
and xapian. Note that if the harness needs to be built, it should always be the
first argument. With no arguments, all applications as well as the harness are
built.

Alternatively, each application has its own build.sh that can be invoked from
the top level directory of that application to build it. Each application
directory also has a clean.sh script for cleaning the build state.

For each application, the build produces three binaries: 
 - *_integrated can be used to run the application in the integrated harness
   configuration
 - *_server_networked and *_client_networked can be used to run the application
   in either the networked or the loopback harness configurations. Note that the
   loopback configuration simply uses localhost as the server IP (see README for
   more information on the three configurations).

Each application directory has run.sh and run_networked.sh scripts that
demonstrate how to run the application in these configurations.
