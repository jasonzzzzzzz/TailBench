- The command line option scale-factor controls the # of warehouses for tpcc

- Option 'workload-mix' (tpcc-specific) controls the mix of various op types in
the workload. There's are five different kinds of ops. See benchmarks/tpcc.c
for details. The variable g_txn_workload_mix is initialized with default vals
(ll 152), and is updated according to the command line option (if specified) in
get_workload().

- Option 'enable-partition-locks' (tpcc-specific) makes workers grab a lock (one
lock per warehouse) before each transaction. The dafault behavior is to not do
this.

- Does disable-gc casue a significant difference in latency? What are the
  trade-offs?

- What effect does the option 'enable-separate-tree-per-partition' (tpcc
  specific) have? 

- After all bench workers have finished, the app waits for all transactions to
  finish before finishing. How do we do this faithfully in zsim? (bench.cc:234)
