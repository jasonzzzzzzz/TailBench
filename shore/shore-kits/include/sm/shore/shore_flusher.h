 *  @brief:  Specialization of a worker thread that acts as the mainstream-flusher.

/**
   Log flushing is a major source of context switches, as well as, of an 
   unexpected but definitely non-scalable problem with the notification of the 
   sleepers on cond vars, which makes almost impossible to saturate workloads 
   like TM1-UpdLocation with very high commit rate that put pressure on the log.

   In order to alleviate the problem with the high rate of context switches and 
   the overuse of condition variables, we implement a staged group
   commit mechanism. The thread that executes the final-rvp of the transaction 
   calls a lazy commit and does not context switch until the corresponding flush 
   completes. Instead it transfers the control to another specialized worker 
   thread, called the flusher. 

   The flusher, monitors the statistics (how many transactions are in the 
   group unflushed, what is the size of the unflushed log, how much time it has 
   passed since the last flush) and makes a decision on when to flush. Typically, 
   if up to T msecs or N bytes or K xcts are unflushed a call to flush is 
   triggered.  

   worker:
   {  ...
      commit_xct(lazy);
      flusher->enqueue_toflush(pxct); } 

   
   flusher:
   while (true) {
      if (time_to_flush()) {
         flush_all();
         while (pxct = toflush_queue->get_one()) {
            pxct->notify_final_rvp(); 
         }
      }
   }

   In order to enable this mechanism Shore-kits needs to be configured with:
   --enable-dflusher
