6.0.1-alpha: Mon May 24 10:15:01 MDT 2010

This is a major overhaul of the storage manager.

It is a port of the entire storage manager and its tests to true concurrent
pthreads. It no longer uses sthreads and its primitives. This release
is an extension of the SHORE-MT release (http:TODO) 

Included are too many bug fixes and change to enumerate them.
The documentation is strictly html; the .pdf files of prior releases
are gone.
