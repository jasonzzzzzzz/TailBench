/* 
  NOTICE of alterations in Spencer's regex implementation :
  The following alterations were made to Henry Spencer's regular 
  expressions implementation, in order to make it build in the
  Shore configuration scheme:

  1) the generated .ih files are no longer generated. They are
    considered "sources".  Likewise for regex.h.
  2) names were changed to w_regexex, w_regerror, etc by i
    #define statements in regex.h
  3) all the c sources were protoized and gcc warnings were 
    fixed.
  4) This entire notice was put into the .c, .ih, and .h files
