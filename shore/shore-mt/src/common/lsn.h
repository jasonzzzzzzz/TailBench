/* FRJ: Major changes to lsn_t
 * Once the database runs long enough we will run out of
 * partition numbers (only 64k possible). 
 * Fortunately, this is a log, so lsn_t don't last forever. 
 * Eventually things become durable and the log partition 
 * file gets reclaimed (deleted). 
 * As long as the first partition is gone before 
 * the last one fills, we can simply wrap and change the 
 * sense of lsn_t comparisions.
 * as follows:
 *
   Suppose we use unsigned 8 bit partition numbers. If the current
   global lsn has pnum >= 128 (MSB set), any lsn we encounter with
   pnum < 128 (MSB clear) must be older:
                                                                               
   0        1        ...        126        127        128        129        ...         254        255
       

   On the other hand, if the current global lsn has pnum < 128
   (MSB clear), any lsn we encounter with pnum >= 128 (MSB set)
   must be *older* (ie, the pnum recently wrapped from 255 back to
   0):

   128        129        ...         254        255        0        1        ...        126        127

   The first situation is easy: regular comparisons provide the
   ordering we want; The second is trickier due to the wrapping of
   partition numbers. Fortunately, there's an easy way around the
   problem!  Since the MSB of the pnum is also the MSB of the
   64-bit value holding the lsn, if comparisons interpret the
   64-bit value as signed we get the proper ordering:

   -128        -127        ...        -2        -1        0        1        ...        126        127

   We assume there are enough lsn_t that less than half are in use at
   a time. So, we divide the universe of lsn's into four regions,
   marked by the most significant two bits of the file.

   00+01 - don't care
   01+10 - unsigned comparisons
   10+11 - unsigned comparisons
   11+00 - signed comparisons

   For now, though, we'll just assume overflow doesn't happen ;)

 * \section LLR Locates Log Records 
 * A log sequence number generally points to a record in the log.
 * It consists of two parts:
 * - hi(), a.k.a., file(). This is a number that matches a log partition
 *                         file, e.g., "log.<file>"
 * - lo(), a.k.a., rba(). This is byte-offset into the log partition, and is
 *                        the first byte of a log record, or is the first
 *                        byte after the last log record in the file (where
 *                        the next log record could be written).
 *
 * \note Once the database runs long enough we will run out of
 * partition numbers (only 64k possible). 
 * Fortunately, this is a log, so lsn_t don't last forever. 
 * Eventually things become durable and the log partition 
 * file gets reclaimed (deleted). 
 * As long as the first partition is gone before 
 * the last one fills, we can simply wrap and change the 
 * sense of lsn_t comparisions.
 *
 * \subsection WORK Identifying Limit of Partial Rollback
 *
 * A savepoint (sm_save_point_t) is an lsn_t. It tells how far back
 * a transaction should undo its actions when ss_m::rollback_work is called.
 *
 * \section PTS Page Timestamps
 * Each page has an lsn_t that acts as a timestamp; it is the
 * lsn of the last log record that describes an update to the page.
 *
 * In recovery, when a page is read in, all log records with sequence
 * numbers less than the page lsn have been applied, and redo of these
 * log records is not necessary.
 *
 * The storage manager has other special cases: lsn_t(0,1) -- this is
 * in page.cpp, page_p::_format(), and indicates a freshly formatted page
 * with no further updates.
 * \subsection NPCD Nominal Page Corruption-Detection
 * Pages have two copies of their page lsn; one at the head and one at the
 * end of the page. Presumably if the two match, the page is uncorrupted,
 * though that is no guarantee.  Certainly if they do not match, 
 * something is wrong.
 *
 * \section BPFS Buffer Pool Frame Status 
 * The buffer pool's control blocks (bfcb_t) contain an lsn_t,
 * the "recovery lsn" or rec_lsn.  This is a timestamp that can
 * be compared with the page lsns to determine if the copy in the
 * buffer pool is up-to-date or not.
 *
 * A recovery lsn is a lower bound on the lsn of a log record
 * that updated the page in the frame. 
 * A clean page in the buffer pool has a rec_lsn of lsn_t::null.
 * Each time a page is fixed in EX mode, the buffer control block 
 * ensures that the rec_lsn is not lsn_t::null, thereby indicating that
 * this page is probably dirty and needs flushing or, possibly, 
 * is being flushed. 
 * The rec_lsn is set to the tail of the log at the time the fix is done; this
 * ensures that any log record written for an update to the page has at
 * least the rec_lsn sequence number. There might be several updates to
 * the page before the page is cleaned, so the rec_lsn is indeed a lower
 * bound, and that's all we can know about it.
 *
 * Special cases of log sequence numbers:
 * - null: not a valid lsn_t
 * - max:  soon to overflow
 * - lsn(0,1) : used when some pages are formatted.

/**\brief Log Sequence Number. See \ref LSNS.
 *
 * \ingroup LSNS
 * \details
 *
 * A log sequence number points to a record in the log.
 * It consists of two parts:
 * - hi(), a.k.a., file(). This is a number that matches a log partition
 *                         file, e.g., "log.<file>"
 * - lo(), a.k.a., rba(). This is byte-offset into the log partition, and is
 *                        the first byte of a log record, or is the first
 *                        byte after the last log record in the file (where
 *                        the next log record could be written).
 *
 * All state is  stored in a single 64-bit value. 
 * This reading or setting is atomic on 
 * 64-bit platforms (though updates still need protection). 
 * \warning This is NOT atomic on 32-bit platforms.
 *
 * Because all state fits in 64 bits, 
 * there is a trade-off between maximum supported log partition size 
 * and number of partitions. Two reasonable choices are:
 *
 * - 16-bit partition numbers, up to 256TB per partition
 * - 32-bit partition numbers, up to 4GB per partition
 *
 * 48-bit offsets are larger, but (slightly) more expensive and likely 
 * to wrap sooner. 
 * 32-bit offsets are still pretty big, and the chance of wrapping 
 * is *much* smaller (though a production system could theoretically 
 * hit the limit, since the count persists as long as the database 
 * exists. 
 * For now we go with the 32-32 split.
 *
 * lsn_t no longer cares whether the disk can handle the full range
 * it supports. 
 * If you support 48-bit partition sizes and the disk can
 * only handle 32-bit offsets, the largest file will just happen to be
 * smaller than lsn_t technically supports.
 *
 * lsn_t does not cater to unaligned accesses. 
 * Log writes, in particular, 
 * are expected to be 8-byte aligned. 
 * The extra wasted bytes just aren't worth the performance hit of allowing
 * misalignment.
 *
 * \note Once the database runs long enough we will run out of
 * partition numbers (only 64k possible). 
 * Fortunately, this is a log, so lsn_t don't last forever. 
 * Eventually things become durable and the log partition 
 * file gets reclaimed (deleted). 
 * As long as the first partition is gone before 
 * the last one fills, we can simply wrap and change the 
 * sense of lsn_t comparisions.
