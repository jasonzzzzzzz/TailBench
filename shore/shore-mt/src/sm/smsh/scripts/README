These scripts are collected into groups by function,
and by purpose.

bugs/* are scripts that need to be debugged. I don't know if the
	scripts are buggy or the sm is buggy. Some of these are
	possibly obsolete.

*.perf - useful for performance. Some are also useful for regression
	testing, but some use so much space, they might NOT be useful	
	for the latter.

long.all: especially long-running scripts; might want to keep them
	out of the regression tests by default.

2PC-related scripts - are not included in the regression tests:
coord*
subord*
trans.3

*.st -- obsolete and once used when ssh was configured with -DUSE_VERIFY

cleanup.all -- for cleaning up Tcl variables

empty --  empty script -- for use with some test shell scripts

all --  for normal "regression" testing.
	if you want to include the long tests, edit "all" and
	set the variable at the top, as indicated by the comment
	there.
