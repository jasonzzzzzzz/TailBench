# Example .shoreconfig file for smsh
#
# Edit a copy of this as you see fit, and save it as
# ~/.shoreconfig or ./.shoreconfig.
#

# Options have the form:
#		type.class.progname.option
#
# type = general type of program ("smsh" for the smsh server)
# class = class of program within type (server or client or whatever
#		application chooses)
# progname = program executable name (don't use a.out)
# option = specific name of option
#
# e.g., smsh.server.smsh.smsh_libdir  
#

#
# STORAGE MANAGER OPTIONS
#

# if you want your log to be on a different device,
# change sm_logdir or make log a link somewhere into
# the desired device
#
*.server.*.sm_logdir: ./log

# use sm_reformat_log to reinitialize a log that is a raw device
*.server.*.sm_reformat_log: no

# Need 100000 to get through the scripts with 32KB pages
#
# For the large record scripts in smsh, with volume size 150000(KB)
# and with 45%-full log warn we need about 9 GB log.
# This is too big for a 32-bit build and we have to decrease the
# log size and the volume size for that platform.
*.server.*.sm_logsize: 9000000

# Specify the sm buffer pool size for any program
# 400 pages, or 3.2 meg:
*.server.*.sm_bufpoolsize: 3200

# Warn VAS when log is this % full -- set low for testing purposes
*.server.*.sm_log_warn: 45

# Number of page writers. Should be at least as many as you have spindles.
# Should benefit from some parallelism even if you don't have multiple
# spindles.
*.server.*.sm_num_page_writers: 2

# set the logging level for the error log to info
*.server.*.sm_errlog_level: info

#
# SSH OPTIONS
#
# This is the tcl library directory for smsh
smsh.server.*.smsh_libdir: ./lib
# location of the .smshrc file
smsh.server.*.smsh_smshrc: ./.smshrc
