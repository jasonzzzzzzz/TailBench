/*
 *
 * Cuckoo-hashing-based hash table for the buffer pool manager.
 * 
 * Each (direct)bucket in the table has SLOT_COUNT slots (compile-time
 * parameter).  With the proper hash functions and #slots/bucket, 
 * it should be rare that a(n) (extended)bucket includes more than 
 * one table bucket, i.e., that an item has to move to an alternative
 * location.  That's the theory, anyway.  In practice, as with all
 * hashing, it depends on the hash functions.  With a single volume
 * and integer page #s in a small range (e.g., 0->10K) this is not
 * necessarily the case, and our unit-testing shows that collisions 
 * happen enough that we need to have SLOT_COUNT >2.
 *
 * The hash table insert fails to insert if it reaches a 
 * limit: the # of moves that it has to perform to get an item to fit,
 * or the number of times it looks for an empty slot.  (These could
 * be different if we had cycles, in which case it might not actually
 * move something, but cycles through table buckets looking for
 * space and not finding that it can move anything.) These two limits
 * are combined into one limit here: BMAX (compile-time constant)
 *
 * TODO: In event of failure, the hash table will have to be rebuilt with
 * different hash functions, or will have to be modified in some way, and
 * at this writing, we haven't handled this case. 
 *
 *
 * NOTE: re: unit-testing.  The tests/ directory has a test called 
 * htab, which can be used to exercise the htab in various ways to
 * see its behavior with different buffer sizes and page ranges.
 * It is a single-threaded, contrived scenario; and (as we hope)
 * it might be the only way you can force a failure case to test
 * the handling of that case.
