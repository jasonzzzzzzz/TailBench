/* Turns out that we can't even afford a central mutex long enough to
   traverse the in-transit list. So, the New Way is not to have an in- 
   transit list at all.

   When a page gets evicted, its entry in the htab disappears
   atomically. If a new thread comes looking for the page later,
   it won't find anything in the htab and will have to call grab().

   At the start of a page grab, the thread acquires the transit bucket
   mutex in order to prevent other grabs to the same page.

/*
 * This corresponds to part of the changes described in Shore-MT paper,
 * 6.2.3, page 10, handling of in-transit-out pages.
 *
 * Each bucket supports only a limited number of
 * in-transit-out pages; the replacement algorithm is aware of the
 * limitation and will not evict a page when its transit bucket is
 * full. 
 *
 * At the beginning of grab(),
 * Latch the new frame in EX mode and install it in the
 * htab. Then, (maybe) wait for in-transit-out to complete, perform
 * read, and (maybe) downgrade the latch.
