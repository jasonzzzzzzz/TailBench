       part of an implied 53-bit fixed-point number which can take
       values ranging from 1.000... to 1.111...). 

       The idea is to left-justify our random bits in the mantissa
       field (hence the << 4). Setting S=0 and E=0x3ff=1023 gives
       (-1)**0 * 2**(0x3ff-1023) * 1.F = 1.F, which is always
       normalized. We then subtract 1.0 to get the answer we actually
       want -- 0.F -- and make the hardware normalize it for us.
