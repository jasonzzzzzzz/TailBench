/* A memory-mapped array which exploits the capabilities provided by
   mmap in order to grow dynamically without moving existing data or
   wasting memory.

   Ideal for situations where you don't know the final size of the
   array, the potential maximum is known but very large, and a
   threaded environment makes it unsafe to resize by reallocating.

   NOTE: the array only supports growing, under the assumption that
   any array which can shrink safely at all can shrink safely to size
   zero (with the data copied to a new, smaller dynarray)

   This approach makes the most sense in a 64-bit environment where
   address space is cheap.

   Note that most systems cannot reserve more than 2-8TB of
   contiguous address space (32-128TB total), most likely because most
   machines don't have that much swap space anyway.
