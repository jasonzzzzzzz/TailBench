 *
 * This read-write lock is implemented around a queue-based lock. It is
 * the basis for latches in the storage manager.
 *
 * Use this to protect data structures that get constantly hammered by
 * short reads, and less frequently (but still often) by short writes.
 *
 * "Short" is the key word here, since this is spin-based.

    /* \todo  TODO: Add support for blocking if any of the spins takes too long.
     * 
       There are three spins to worry about: spin_on_writer,
       spin_on_reader, and spin_on_waiting

       The overall idea is that threads which decide to block lose
       their place in line to avoid forming convoys. To make this work
       we need to modify the spin_on_waiting so that it blocks
       eventually; the mcs_lock's preemption resistance will take care
       of booting it from the queue as necessary.

       Whenever the last reader leaves it signals a cond var; when a
       writer leaves it broadcasts.
