<H2>1.0 Overview 
</H2>
<P>&nbsp;SPECjbb2005 is a software benchmark product developed by the
Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC), a non-profit
group of computer vendors, system integrators, universities, research
organizations, publishers, and consultants. It is designed to measure
a system's ability to run Java server applications. &nbsp;SPECjbb2005
is closely based on SPECjbb2000, which was inspired by the TPC-C
benchmark and loosely follows the TPC-C specification for its schema,
input generation, and operation profile. SPECjbb2005 replaces
database tables with Java classes and replaces data records with Java
objects. The objects are held in memory as Java Collection instances
or other Java data objects.</P>
<P>SPECjbb2005 is implemented as a Java 5.0 application emulating a
3-tier system with emphasis on the middle tier. All three tiers are
implemented within the same JVM (though the benchmark may spawn
several JVM instances).. 
</P>
<P>The system modeled is still a wholesale company, with warehouses
that serve a number of districts. There are a set of operations that
customers (also known as users) initiate, such as placing new orders
or requesting the status of an existing order. Additional operations
are generated within the company, such as processing orders for
delivery, entering customer payments, checking stock levels, and
requesting a report on recent activity by a given customer. &nbsp;There
is only one user active per warehouse. A warehouse is a unit of
stored data. It contains roughly 25 MB of data stored in Java
Collection objects.&nbsp; Users map directly to Java threads. Each
thread executes operations in sequence, with each operation selected
from the operation mix using a probability distribution. As the
number of warehouses increases during the full benchmark run, so does
the number of threads. 
</P>
<P>SPECjbb2005 is totally self contained and self driving (generates
its own data, generates its own multi-threaded operations, and does
not depend on any package beyond the JRE). 
</P>
<P>SPECjbb2005 is memory resident, performs no I/O to disks, has only
local network I/O, and has no think times. 
</P>
<P>SPECjbb2005 results are not comparable to results for either
SPECjbb2000 or TPC-C.&nbsp; Comparisons to either &nbsp;would be a
SERIOUS violation of SPEC's run and reporting rules and of TPC's
&quot;fair use policy.&quot; Violations are subject to penalties. 
</P>
<H2><A NAME="Internals"></A>2.0 What&rsquo;s New in SPECjbb2005 
</H2>
<P>&nbsp;For details on the design of SPECjbb2000 refer to <A HREF="http://www.spec.org/jbb2000/docs/whitepaper.html">the
SPECjbb2000 design document</A>. &nbsp;</P>
<P>The database is now modeled, not as a BTree structure implemented
in code in the benchmark itself, but in structures that are
implemented as HashMaps, or TreeMaps in cases where some operations
on the table requires sorting.&nbsp; The intention is for the
benchmark to reflect the practice of Java developers to use libraries
where they provide appropriate functionality, rather than to code
implementations of their own.</P>
<P>SPECjbb2005 now includes no System.GC calls in the main part of
the benchmark.&nbsp; The intention is to reflect the behavior of
long-running applications not interrupted by periodic System.GC
calls.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">In
order to better match current application characteristics, the
handling of all financial data and calculations was changed from
float to BigDecimal. This matches current industry practice, and
ensures that the financial amounts and calculations have correct
decimal representation and rounding expected, and sometimes legally
mandated, for currency calculations.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
code was refactored in a number of places to better reflect
object-oriented styles of programming.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><BR>
</P>
<P>The current Java level is now Java 5.0, and the benchmark includes
several features from that language level.&nbsp; Several Collection
data structures have been made generic, and the source code contains
several uses of auto-boxing and enumeration types.</P>
<P>The transaction logging is now done by building and writing DOM
objects using the JAXP XML functionality of Java 5.0.</P>
<P>The benchmark may also deploy several instances of the JRE, each
independently handling the transaction load on its own data tables.&nbsp;
</P>
<H2><A NAME="Code_Structure"></A>&nbsp;3.0 Code Structure

<P>The benchmark code is shipped in jar files. In addition, source
code is provided in the src subdirectory for reference. Please note
<A HREF="RunRules.html#Benchmark_Binaries">section 2.2 of the run
rules</A> prohibiting recompilation for published results. 
</P>
<P>The code contained in the jar files are:

</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=3>The /reporter subdirectory contains the files

</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>The underlying data structures for the fields in the

Item.java, Stock.java, Customer.java., Address.java.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>The database is that for one company, represented by
an instance of the class defined in Company.java; it has a varying
number of Warehouse objects, as defined in Warehouse.java, and each
of these has a number of districts, defined in District.java.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company has three major tables of data, the Item
table, the CustomerTable, and the CustomerbyLastNameTable.&nbsp; Each
Warehouse object has its own StockTable and HistoryTable.&nbsp; Each
District has its own OrderTable and NewOrderTable.&nbsp; All the
tables are instances of either JBBDataStorage or
JBBSortedDataStorage.&nbsp; These latter classes are defined in
&nbsp;JBBDataStorage.java, JBBSortedStorage.java,
Infrastructure.java, MapStorage.java.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>Order.java and NewOrder.java define the order objects
representing the orders that drive the transactions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>There are six different types of transactions that
are carried out, defined in NewOrderTransaction.java,
OrderStatusTransaction.java, DeliveryTransaction.java,
PaymentTransaction.java, StockLevelTransaction.java, and
CustomerReportTransaction.java. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>The main benchmark loop is run by a collection of
user threads each running TransactionManager.go(), controlled by a
main thread running Company.displayResultTotals.&nbsp; Each user
thread is running a while loop carrying out a randomized series of
transactions. When there is more than one JVM running in the
benchmark there is an initial ramp-up period of 3 seconds, to make
sure all threads are running before measurement of the transaction
rate begins, and also a ramp-down period of 20 seconds. Measurements
are done for 30 seconds for warehouses up to the expected peak, and
for four minutes after that..&nbsp; Each thread collects and writes
transaction data for future reference. In a single-JVM run with many
warehouses, the start-up time is part of the measurmeent period and
erratic results may be seen before the expected peak because of the
shorter measurement interval.</FONT></P>
<P>Class file diagrams for the various classes in the benchmark can
be seen in <A HREF="#AppendixA">Appendix A</A> at the end.</P>
<H2>4.0 Performance Metrics 
</H2>
<P>SPECjbb2005 has two performance metrics, bops (business operations
per second), which is the overall rate at which business operations
are performed per second, and bops/JVM, the first metric divided by
the number of JVMs running during the benchmark, 
</P>
<P>The single-JVM metric is calculated as follows.</P>
<P>A &quot;point&quot; represents a measurement period of work done
at a given number of warehouses. A full benchmark run consists of a
sequence of measurement points with an increasing number of
warehouses (and thus an increasing number of threads). 
</P>
<P>The SPECjbb2005 metrics for a compliant run are calculated as
follows: 
</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><P>All points (numbers of warehouses) are run, from 1 up to
	MaxWh (the number specified by input.ending_number of warehouses in
	SPECjbb.props) warehouses.. At a minimum all points from 1 to 8 must
	be run. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>For numbers of warehouses from 1 to the expected peak number
	M of warehouses (the number of warehouses at which the peak is
	expected to be observed, either specified by a nonzero
	input.expected_peak_warehouse in SPECjbb.props, or defined as
	Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors() if the property is set to 0
	), there is a 30-second measurement period.&nbsp; For larger numbers
	of warehouses, the measurement period is four minutes. All JVM
	instances run these measurement periods together.</P>
	<LI><P>The total throughputs of all the instances for all the points
	from M warehouses to 2*M inclusive warehouses are averaged. This
	average is the SPECjbb2005 metric 'bops'. As explained in section
	2.3 of the run and reporting rules, results from systems that do not
	run all points up to 2*M warehouses are still considered valid. For
	all the missing points in the range M+1 to 2*M, the throughput is
	considered to be 0 bops in the metric computation. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The second SPECjbb2005 metric, bops/JVM is obtained by
	dividing value of bops for the run by the number of JVM instances
	used in the run.</P>
</UL>
<P>The reporting tool contained within SPECjbb2005 produces a graph
of the throughput at all the measured points with warehouses on the
horizontal axis and throughputs on the vertical axis, totalled, and
for each individual JVM. All points from 1 to the maximum of 8 and
MaxWh are reported. Missing points in the range M+1 to 2*M will be
reported to have a throughput of 0 bops. The points being
averaged for the metric will be marked on the report. 
</P>
<H2><A NAME="conclusions"></A>5.0 Conclusions 
</H2>
<P>While SPECjbb2005 is not a full blown OLTP benchmark, it is a very
good stand-in for a large business application. It is also a very
good functional and performance test for Java platforms. It has been
found to effectively exercise the implementation of the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM), Just-in-time compiler (JIT), garbage collection,
threads, parts of the Java library, and some aspects of the operating
system. The benchmark measures the performance of CPUs, caches,
memory hierarchy and the scalability of Shared Memory Processing
Systems.</P>
